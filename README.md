## Reference Manager

Zotero is an open source software which means it is free and accessible to all. Zotero much like other reference managers offers some helpful features such as organising your resources into Collections which you can think of as Bookshelfs, within Libraries. 

### Zotero
[Downloading Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/)

[Browser Connector](https://www.zotero.org/start)

You can choose to import your references through the browser connector, with the *magic wand* whenever you have a DOI or you can read in a range of file formats storing reference metadata. 

### Zotero Extensions

You can customise the labelling of your citation keys (firstauthorYEAR) or including the title, whichever is easier to recall. To do this you will need to add the following Add-on Tools.

- [Citation Key Extension](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/)

You can also choose to highlight or take snapshots of different documents within collections to take notes of what you read along the way.  

- [PDF Annotations](https://zotfile.com/)

## Syncing Your Files 

With DropBox you will be able to sync the files you upload onto the browser based compiler with your local directory. Overleaf projects most times require a folder for figures, any images or attachments you may wish to integrate in your writing. 

[DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/install)

To open the set of Obsidian files that can serve as your template to set up a Vault, you can navigate to the previously specified folder
path where you have cloned these files onto your local directory.

## Writing-Up

### Accessing Overleaf:
[Single Sign on Institution for Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Institutional_single_sign-on)

[GANTT chart Template](https://www.overleaf.com/7916624512qwtjsvhdtztw#7a7ea3)

Make a copy of this GANTT chart template should you wish to edit and customise it to your own project. You can then choose
to save the figure in the form of a pdf.

### Syncing Overleaf:

To ensure that we streamline all of these works to pair well with each other the following are a set of helpful resources explaining how you can establish a link between the tools you use for reading and writing. 

- [Zotero](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_to_link_your_Overleaf_account_to_Mendeley_and_Zotero)

- [DropBox](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Dropbox_Synchronization)

## Tracking Your Progress

Finally it is important to track your progress or even collaborate on writing up a project with a team. To do this you can explore making a repository out of your project and inviting collaborators to work on this. Overleaf works much like an online shared drive, but it may become complicated fast whenever you have many different moving parts to a project and would like to document important edits or decisions around your writing along the way.
